# Movie Trailer Website
A script which generates a static web page allowing to browse a list of my
favorite movies, including box art imagery and ability to watch a YouTube
trailer.

## Installation
Assuming you have installed Git:

`git clone http://github.com/denseleznev/`

## Usage
Inside the folder `movies` run the following code:

The script will then generate HTML page which will automatically open in a
web browser. Click on any movie poster to watch YouTube trailer.
